<br>

## 2 - [ ] Simulating/gathering data and work/interpretate them (statistics, count, combinatorics) (second hardest part & high priority) on data branch / math branch

    View blackjack/data branch

## 3 - [ ] Righting the results/stats to a CSV (maybe JSON) file for interpretation and SQL (medium-priority) on data branch

    View data branch

<br>

## 4 - [ ] Implement CSV results in a SQL Database (MySQL probably) (third hardest part) (medium-priority) on db branch

    View db branch

## 5 - [ ] Load & preprocess data for neural network w/ TensorFlow (hardest part) (high-priority) on neural network branch

    View data/neural-network branch

<br>

## 6 - [ ] Visualizing results (low priority) on math or data branch, maybe create a new one
