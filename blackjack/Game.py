"""
- This file will contain the Game class (prob. most important).
- It will take no argument in the constructor (maybe the bet)
- The class will track the constant win/loss rates & current benifit/loss
- All constants are inherited from Deck.py
- It will roll out the whole game of n players from the bets to 
the outcomes (6 different them).
- methods: play(self, bet, num_players), ... 
- it will return the new budget of the player (later more for data-analysis)
