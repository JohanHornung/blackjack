# **Blackjack project for the end of the year (American Blackjack)**

<br><br>

# **Detailed structure of the project (data-science part):**

<br>

## 2 - [ ] Simulating/gathering data and work/interpretate them (statistics, count, combinatorics) (second hardest part & high priority)

    2.1 - [ ] Gathering statistics

        2.1.1 - [ ] Calculate percentages of 1.3 numbers


    2.2 - [ ] Decounting/protocolling of cards (dealer and player(s))

        2.2.1. - [ ] How much numbers/pictures out of the n number of cards ?
        2.2.1. - [ ] Which colors & figures out of these n pictures ?


    2.3 - [ ] Protocolling number of n won/lost games

            2.3.1 - [ ] How much games lost/won out of n total games ? (dealer and player(s))
            2.3.2 - [ ] How much consecutive games lost/won out of n total games ? (dealer and player(s))

<br>

## 3 - [ ] Righting the results/stats to a CSV (maybe JSON) file for interpretation and SQL (medium-priority)

    3.1 - [ ] Store data in (multiple?) CSV files

        3.1.1 - [ ] Define header-rows (gameId, won, reason, cards, dealer_cards...)
        3.1.2 - [ ] Delimiter
        3.1.3 - [ ] Writing to CSV: (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/writing-csv-files)
            3.1.3.1 - [ ] Choose which data structure to use

    3.2 - [ ] Exporting to a seperate file and prepare results for SQL

        3.2.1 - [ ] How-to: https://www.sqlshack.com/importing-and-working-with-csv-files-in-sql-server/
